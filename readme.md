## Setting Up Dev Repo
Following directions assume you're on [OSX](http://brew.sh/) with Homebrew installed.
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `brew install node`
2. Install node version 5.8.0 with your favorite node version manager (I use [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n))
3. Install the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) CLI globally `npm i -g gulp-cli`
4. Install node packages.json dependencies `npm i`
5. Run `gulp` to start a server and compile assets. Run `gulp build` to just build assets with no server.

## Notes
- Vanilla JS (no JQuery)
- Normalize being wrapped into css bundle
