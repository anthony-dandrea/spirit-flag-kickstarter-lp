After several failed startups and a corporate job I disliked, I saw a post on the front page of Reddit called "4chan designs some shirts". The response was incredible - the internet loved them since it was authentic to them, and I did too. I put together a survey to see which designs people wanted most, built an online ecommerce website, and generated $40,000 in sales during Shopify's 30-day trial period.</p><p>After quitting my job and going all in the entrepreneur lifestyle, Shirtwascash expanded from just T-shirts to carrying 11 different products including sweaters, hoodies, mouse pads, girlsâ€™ clothing and our newest product SpiritFlags. The growth was enough that we moved out of my bedroom, into an office and expanded my team to five.</p><p>Up until this point I was known to our fans and community as "Anon", short for anonymous. I stayed anonymous throughout this company because this isn't about me, it's about you and the memories that are created when you wear our clothing. My mission has always been encouraging and motivating people to be happier through expressing their authentic self, and Shirtwascash definitely fulfils that mission.</p></div></div><div class="media glass-bg"><div class="copy"><h1 class="headline">Introducing SpiritFlags</h1><p>The SpiritFlags do and are on another level compared to anything we've ever done before. I sourced every piece of fabric, which is unlike anything people have felt before and didn't exist a few years ago, and endlessly bought the cut back to the drawing board to enable you to wear it anyway you like. We have implemented our high standards of design and the limitless nature of sublimation printing to help create something that is special.</p><p>I made SpiritFlags from scratch using my own imagination, hours of pattern making and stitching and design work. It entirely encompasses what our brand is about and I am beyond excited to start seeing people stand out at events or in daily life. Flags are a symbol of things people identify with which is why I chose to make it wearable. We can print on every inch in full vibrant colors. I feel this will resonate particularly well with the EDM crowd, music festivals, international sports such as football soccer and hockey, and will allow people to express their true authentic self.</p></div><div class="image"><img src="images/intro.jpg"></div></div><div class="glass-bg alignCenter"><h3 class="headline">SpiritFlag Description</h3><img src="images/desc.jpg"></div><div class="glass-bg"><h3 class="headline alignCenter">Approved Media Images</h3><div class="media"><div class="image"><img src="images/factory.jpg"></div><div class="copy"><div class="half"><ul class="unstyled"><li>Founder - Ardon Lukas</li><li>Founded: June 2014</li><li>9.1 Million Page Views</li><li>1.8 Million Unique Users</li><li>50,000 unique users per month</li><li>Five employees</li><li>On track to do seven figures of sales in 2016</li></ul></div><div class="half"><p>The following media items are approved for public use by the media:</p><ul><li><a href="BMX.zip">BMX</a></li><li><a href="Flyboard.zip">Flyboard</a></li><li><a href="Guitar.zip">Guitar</a></li><li><a href="Manufacturing.zip">Manufacturing</a></li><li><a href="SpiritFlagsGIFs.zip">Style Shots</a></li><li><a href="Style.zip">SpiritFlag GIFs</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="glass-bg"><h3 class="headline alignCenter">Meet The Team</h3><div class="people"><div><img src="images/ardon.jpg" alt="ardon"><p>Ardon Lukasiewicz, CEO</p></div><div><img src="images/brian.jpg" alt="brian"><p>Brian Arredondo, COO</p></div><div><img src="images/naomi.jpg" alt="naomi"><p>Naomi Curiel, Design Specialist</p></div><div><img src="images/nicole.jpg" alt="nicole"><p>Nicole West, Executive Coordinator</p></div><div><img src="images/stephen.jpg" alt="stephen"><p>Stephen Holloway, Shipping &amp; Logistics</p></div></div></div><div class="glass-bg"><h3 class="headline">Contact Us</h3><p>Thank you very much for checking out new SpiritFlags, We are always open to partnership dieas so below is a list of our email contacts.</p><p>For press please email <a href="mailto:contact@shirtwascash.com">contact@shirtwascash.com</a></p><p>For partnerships and licensing please email <a href="mailto:partnerships@shirtwascash.com">partnerships@shirtwascash.com</a></p><p>For general questions and comments please email <a href="mailto:anon@shirtwascash.com">anon@shirtwascash.com</a></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="script.min.js"></script></body></html>
